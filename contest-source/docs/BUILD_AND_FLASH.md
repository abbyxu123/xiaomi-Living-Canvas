- Team manifest revision: `224850b197da7837e60b45573af26a479d366dd9`
- Official docs revision: `cb0389919ea4fc86774702fb36c08ee9b1366e6c`

- Pinned manifest: `/home/abby/openvela-workspace/pinned-manifest.xml`
- `repo sync -c -j2`: completed successfully
- Before AI integration, `distclean` plus exact restoration of known tracked build side effects left the intended source repositories clean.
- Full post-build `repo status` contains expected manifest linkfile/nested-project overlays and generated build files; it is not described as globally clean.

## Clean baseline result

Status: `BASELINE_BUILD_PASSED`

The clean board baseline used the unmodified `nsh_minidisplay` configuration. It did **not** copy the AI Agent defconfig and did **not** run `fix_gemini_s1.sh`; those are separate, source-changing integration steps that require their own before/after status and build evidence.

Verified build command in Ubuntu:

```bash
cd /home/abby/openvela-workspace

QEMU_LD_PREFIX=/usr/x86_64-linux-gnu \
QEMU_SET_ENV=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/abby/.local/share/openvela-x86_64-jammy/root/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
./build.sh vendor/allwinnertech/boards/r528/r528s3-gemini-s1/configs/nsh_minidisplay/ -j2
```

Result:

- Exit code: `0`
- Completed: `2026-09-14 10:24:19 UTC`
- Linker memory report: `13,639,036 B` used in the SDRAM region (`1.42%`)
- Remaining guest root storage after build: about `72 GiB`
- Remaining available guest memory after build: about `7.3 GiB`

Verified outputs:

| Output | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `nuttx/nuttx` | 7,345,972 | `05566f786bda3b9820adb5f21f6ae6c6dbf6b3796a54c9d2b6bda1eafe4f9996` |
| `nuttx/nuttx.elf` | 155,426,276 | `5fcdf464591975cb59b7bbb9101c7ee0f2fd785a0a4b33adefca04b9c7be4904` |
| `nuttx/nuttx.bin` | 113,143,844 | `c45d7273d17e9de92f469cb63b43c6acd7962ca2abec4e6cb361e46211047f73` |

`nuttx` and `nuttx.elf` were identified as statically linked ARM EABI5 executables. `vela.bin` and the copied board `nsh.fex` have identical size and SHA-256. A local, ignored backup contains `nsh.fex`, the successful build log, and the pinned manifest under `local-setup/backups/gemini-s1-baseline-20260914/`.

## AI Agent + Living Canvas product result

Status: `PRODUCT_BUILD_PASSED / NOT_FLASHED`

The official Gemini-S1 AI Agent configuration and compatibility patches were applied on local, reversible branches. The team application added only `CONFIG_LVX_USE_DEMO_CONTEST2026_482_LIVING_CANVAS=y` to that board configuration before rebuilding.

Verified build command in Ubuntu:

```bash
QEMU_LD_PREFIX=/usr/x86_64-linux-gnu \
QEMU_SET_ENV=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/abby/.local/share/openvela-x86_64-jammy/root/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
./build.sh vendor/allwinnertech/boards/r528/r528s3-gemini-s1/configs/nsh_minidisplay/ -e -Wno-error -j2
```

Verification proved that `hello_app_main.c`, `lc_clock.c`, `lc_dinner.c`, `lc_memory.c`, `lc_state.c`, and `lc_ui.c` compiled, and `nuttx.elf` contains the public symbol `living_canvas_main`. The board image is `6,003,600` bytes with SHA-256 `876a09162538bb84415cc588a3a0240ccb8b6af5fb24401b61a0c1d27d6cc778`.

The ignored local backup is under `local-setup/backups/gemini-s1-living-canvas-20260914/`. Complete commands, commits, output hashes, and the post-build repository-state qualification are recorded in `tests/evidence/build/gemini-s1-living-canvas-20260914.txt`.

### Independent decision-backend integration

Status: `HOST_FLOW_PASSED / TARGET_REBUILD_PENDING_VM_LOGIN`

The contest repository now contains its own `backend/src/living_canvas_backend`
package. The Gemini-S1 request boundary uses only `lc_backend_contract` names and
the owned `/v1/session`, `/v1/input`, `/v1/device/event`, and `/v1/confirm`
contract. The backend applies hard constraints before either model or rules
selection, requires explicit device confirmation, and hands off to a
whitelisted phone search URL without submitting an order or payment.

On 2026-09-17 the real local HTTP flow passed from session creation through the
compact QR redirect. Thirty-three backend tests, twelve strict C host tests,
the openvela build-metadata check, the LVGL build-metadata check, and the
Living-Canvas-only branding gate also passed. See
`tests/evidence/integration/living-canvas-backend-flow-20260917.txt`.

The current source has not yet been rebuilt inside Ubuntu. The UTM guest was
running, but the guest agent was unavailable and SSH required credentials not
available to the automated build session. No source was copied to the guest and
no new target image was produced. This access boundary is recorded in
`tests/evidence/build/gemini-s1-living-canvas-backend-20260917.txt`; it is not a
compiler failure and does not alter the earlier verified image.

### Bounded-voice product rebuild

The application was then extended with a bounded, in-memory voice-session state
machine. It does not access the microphone, save audio, or use the network. A new
host regression test compiles and executes `living_canvas_main`, in addition to
the six module tests.

The first product rebuild correctly failed on a malformed entry-point `printf`;
the failure, cause, and regression response are retained in
`tests/evidence/build/gemini-s1-voice-entry-red-20260914.txt`. After the fix, all
seven strict host tests and the full Gemini-S1 product build passed. The resulting
`nsh.fex` is `6,003,600` bytes with SHA-256
`c17e48df9da1c0c068cc1cdb521be3156153a63ecaf884b4cf47588635009521`.

The ignored backup is under
`local-setup/backups/gemini-s1-living-canvas-voice-20260914/`; complete hashes and
## ARM64 compatibility record

integration evidence are in `tests/evidence/build/gemini-s1-living-canvas-voice-20260914.txt`.

Two failures were retained rather than overwritten:

1. The native AArch64 GCC prebuilt initially lacked host `libc++.so.1`; Ubuntu `libc++1` resolved it.
2. The pinned tree invoked x86-64 `jidl_gen_cpp` and later x86-64 strip/objcopy binaries. Ubuntu's `qemu-user-static` binfmt handler plus the amd64 cross-runtime resolved execution. The strip tool also required amd64 `libz.so.1`.

To avoid adding the `amd64` architecture or changing APT sources, Ubuntu Jammy's official `zlib1g_1.2.11.dfsg-2ubuntu9.2_amd64.deb` was checksum-verified and extracted to a user-owned directory. Package SHA-256:

```text
9dc17e51a1be2d9ed63b7b84ef0e4e29c5abe6f1bc62cb03e7181483cce8a2f2
```

`QEMU_SET_ENV` limits the extra `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to emulated x86-64 programs; native AArch64 build tools do not inherit an incompatible runtime search path.

## Warnings

The successful build contains upstream LTO/type and NAND `memcpy` warnings plus an empty-loadable-segment warning from strip. They did not produce a nonzero exit or prevent image generation. They remain recorded for later upstream review and must not be rewritten as errors or silently removed from evidence.

## Flash gate

Status: `BLOCKED_FOR_FLASH`

Building an image does not authorize flashing it. No flash, erase, repartition, OTA, recovery-mode entry, or device write has been performed. The first flash remains blocked until the physical board/storage revision, authoritative factory recovery image, package hash, supported flashing tool, exact recovery sequence, console/rollback route, stable power, and user-present confirmation are all verified. See `docs/RECOVERY.md`.
